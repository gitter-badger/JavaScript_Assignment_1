    <h3> Chapter 01 - Basics of JavaScript</h3>

    <article> What are some cross-browser issues that affect JavaScript code?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Web browsers rely on two distinct engines to load and render a webpage.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript Engine </li>
                <li>
                    Rendering Engine
                </li>
            </ul> The inconsistent implementation of web standards by various browser vendors of these engines make it nearly impossible to be absolutely sure if the code we author will behave and appear the same way on every platform. The DOM API provided by each of these vendors differs ever so slightly making it difficult to write simple JavaScript code without having to include shims and polyfills or some sort of fallback mechanism</details>

    <article> What tools are available to deal with these issues?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            It serves us well in general to follow these guidelines to get around these cross-browser issues
            <ul>
                <li>Don't leave anything to the browser to make assumptions. Instead be explicit wherever possible. Ex: include the DOCTYPE for every webpage</li>
                <li> Ensure the HTML document is valid and is wellformed</li>
                <li>Rely on popular JavaScript libraries and CSS frameworks that normalize the cross-browser idiosyncrasies.</li>
                <li>Use popular unit-testing tools such as Jasmine, mocha-chai to run tests in all the browsers using a testrunner such as Karma</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What considerations should we take when determining what browsers to support?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Although various strategies exist, the one that Yahoo follows seems to be more popular. It involves putting together a matrix which Yahoo calls the "graded browser matrix" where the browsers are along one axis and the platforms are along the second axis. We then need to grade them depending on the project requirements

    <article> What sort of testing should we do on JavaScript code before deployment?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Before deploying the JavaScript code, we should be certain that the test cases we author all pass and posses the three main characteristics, namely
            <ol>
                <li>Repeatability</li>
                <li>Simplicity</li>
                <li>Isolation/Independent</li>
            </ol>
            Types of testing would include
            <ul>
                <li>functionality</li>
                <li>performance</li>
                <li>compatibility</li>
            </ul> , There are two approaches to testing the code we write when we bump into a bug and we want to debug it.
            <ol>
                <li>Constructive</li>
                <li>Deconstructive</li>
            </ol>

    <h3>02 - Testing Frameworks</h3>

    <article> What debug tools can we use for JavaScript?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            We can use google chrome developer tools to place break points and perform stepwise execution to debug JavaScript. Also we could use the console.log() method to log to the console.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Explain how deconstructive and constructive test cases work.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <strong>Deconstructive</strong> test cases are composed by isolating just the code that constitute the system-under-test and eleminating the rest of the code that do not participate in the test cases. <strong>Constructive</strong> test cases on the other hand are put together by starting from a known good reduced case and go on adding code to it until a bug shows up.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What is the purpose of a testing framework?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            A good testing framework enables us to organize our tests by grouping them together, allow us to see a dashboard of tests that have passed and the ones that need fixing. When it comes to JavaScript Unit-Testing frameworks aimed at the DOM API, we need a test-framework that can
            <ol>
                <li>simulate browser behavior such as mouse-hover, clicks, drag and drop</li>
                <li>allow us to control the test runner interactively</li>
                <li>give us the ability to filter what tests are to be executed</li>
                <li>provide a way to test asynchronous operations by grouping all those that depend on the same asynchronous operation</li>
            </ol>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Name a few testing frameworks for JavaScript.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            following are some of the popular JavaScript Testing Frameworks
            <ul>
                <li>Jasmine</li>
                <li>mocha with chai</li>
                <li>QUnit</li>
                <li>JsUnit</li>

    <h3> Chapter 03 -  Functions</h3>

    <article> Explain how functions work in JavaScript
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <li>JavaScript functions can be invoked in one of four ways.
                <ol>
                    <li>as a function</li>
                    <li>as a method on an object</li>
                    <li>as an object constructor</li>
                    <li>as apply/call </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Every function is implicitly provided with two additional parameters, namely "this" and "arguments". The "this" parameter is influenced by above the invokation patterns (listed above) used </li>
            <li>Additionally, JavaScript functions are basically objects (mutable key-value pairs) and are instances of the core JavaScript object named "Function" Therefore every function has a hidden link to "Function.prototype". Which means that anything attached to the Function.prototype instantly becomes available to all instances the functions.
            </li>
            <li>Every function has a property called "prototype" which is an object consisting of a property called "constructor" whose value is the function itself.</li>
            <li>functions can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, they can be passed to other functions as arguments and returned from other functions as values.</li>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How are they declared?
        <details class="question"><summary>Answer:</summary>
        We could use one of two syntaxes to declare JavaScript functions.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>function declaration/statement syntax</strong> where the function declaration is hoisted to the top of the function scope.
                <details><summary>code</summary>
                <div class="code">example:
                
    function bar(){
        //code here
    }
               </div></details>
            </li>
            <li><strong>function expression sytax(the preferred way)</strong> where the function declaration is <strong>not</strong> hoisted and can only be called <strong>after</strong> the function has been defined.
                <details><summary>code</summary>        <div class="code">example:
                
    var bar = function bar(){
        //code here
    }
              OR
    
    var bar = function (){
        //code here
    }
               </div></details>
            </li>
        </ul></details>
    </article>
    <article> Where can they be used?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <ul>
              <li>functions can be used to create objects when invoked with a new keyword</li>
              <li>functions can be used to implement callbacks that could be either synchronous or asynchronous</li>
               <li>A function can be executed within the context of an object as a method</li>
               <li>functions that are in the outermost scope are actually methods on the global object. In the case of browser, the functions are methods on the global "window" object. However, they can be invoked without referencing the global object.</li>
                <li>functions can be stored in variables, objects, arrays.</li>
                <li>They can be passed to other functions as arguments and can be returned from functions.</li>
                            </ul>
             
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How do we call them?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            There are several ways of calling a function
            <ul>
                <li>As a regular function. example: add(3,4);</li>
                <li>As a method on an object.example : myObj.add(3,4)</li>
                <li>As a constructor. example: var cal = new Calculater();</li>
                <li>
                    With a Apply/Call invocation (which allows setting the context for the method).example
                    add.call(MyObj,3,5); or add.apply(MyObj,[3,5]);
                </li>
                 <li>a function may also be invocked as follos
                     var bar = function(a,b){ return a + b;};
                     bar.prototype.constructor();
                 </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Are there any special characteristics that differentiate them from other programming languages’ functions?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript functions are objects. Which means that they can in-turn have methods and properties. Which makes it possible to memoize previously computed expensive operations, thereby making it possible to author performant code</li>
                <li>JavaScript functions have the ability to dynamically bind the execution context with object using "apply" and "call" pattern of invocation.</li>
                <li>By default, all JavaScript functions receive two additional bonus parameters, namely "this" and "arugments". The arguments parameter makes it possible to turn the function into one that can accept var-args</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How are parameters handled by functions?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            If a function is called by passing in more arguments than it can take, the extra arguments are ignored and if a function is called with fewer arguments than it takes, the called function proceeds with the execution by sticking in "undefined" for those parameters that didn't receive any value.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Can we define var-args functions?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            We can achieve this by leveraging the implicitly passed bonus parameter called "arguments". It is basically an array-like object which holds the parameters passed to it as arguments from the calling function.
        </details>         
    </article>
    <article> How can we define a variable’s type?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            As JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, the variable's type is determined by the type of value we assign to it        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How are variables declared?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            variables are declared with a "var" keyword;
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What is the purpose of the var keyword?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            "var" keyword is used to declare a variable. In ES5, the use of var keyword for a variable inside a function, influences it's scope. When "use strict" is not used, forgetting to use the var keyword for a variable intended as a local variable will cause to silently be scoped to its outer namespace.

    <article> Describe briefly how JavaScript code is executed on the browser.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Within the browser, the JavaScript code is interpreted and executed by the JavaScript Runtime Engine. Although we can author and execute JavaScript code without involving the DOM API, it would be meaningless to do so as we most certainly would want our code to work with the DOM. When coding against the DOM API, the code we author is hooked in as eventhandlers. These eventhandlers are nothing but callback functions that are queued in on the "eventloop" (that runs on a single-thread) and executed in a first-come-first-served basis like any good queues would. The thread that registers events on the "eventloop" is separate from the one on which the eventloop itself runs.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What is a callback?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            To my mind, a JavaScript callback is what C programming langauge calls "function pointer" and C# calls a "delegate". It is basically a function that gets executed at a later time when it's turn matures on the eventloop queue (asynchronous callback) or is simply executed by some other code (synchronous callback). We can't tell if a callback in question is synchronous or asynchronous until we consult the API documentation.
<div class="code">example of syncrhonous callback;
var bar = function(){
    return baz(function(msg){
        console.log(msg + ' Shardul');
    });
};
var baz = function(cb){
    return cb('Ola');
};
      
/*Another simple example of a synchronous callback would be Array.sort()*/
      
var myArray = [23,44,10,9,5,20];
myArray.sort(function(a,b){
    return a - b;
});
       </div>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How does scoping work in JavaScript?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            In JavaScript, the code is always scoped to "function" and not "block". The variables that are declared (with a var keyword) within a  function context stay local to it and are inaccessible outside. Skipping to declare it within the function (with a var keyword) will cause it to be implicitly considered as a global variable.It is thus a good practice to always include 'use strict'; as the first line in every top-level function to enforce declaring local variables with a var keyword. Failing to declare it with a var keyword will cause it to error out (with an uncaught ReferenceError), unless the variable is declared in the outer scope.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What is Hoisting?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            The variable declaration in JavaScript is subject to "hoisting" which simply means, all declarations are moved to the top of the function by the interpreter. When it comes to functions, the function <strong>definitions</strong> (also known as statements) are hoisted to the top of the function and not function <strong>expressions</strong>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How does the context of a function work in JavaScript?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            The <strong>context</strong> of a JavaScript function is nothing but the object on which the function will be attached to as a <strong>method</strong> and when invoked, will behave like a any other method on that object.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Is it possible to alter it? If so, how?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Yes it is. We can do so using either apply or call methods that exist on every function, like so
            <div class="code">
var setName = function(fn,ln){
    this.firstName = fn;
    this.lastName = ln;
};            
var Person = {};
setName.call(Person,'Shardul','Ghanti'); // or setName.apply(Person,['Shardul','Ghanti']);
console.log(Person.firstName + ' ' + Person.lastName);           
                   
            </div>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What happens when a function is called using the new keyword?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            When a JavaScript function is called with a new keyword,the function is executed as an object constructor and a new object is created on the heap. If there are properties and methods attached to it's prototype,they become available to this new object created. 
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Explain how the this keyword works in JavaScript.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            the <strong>this</strong> keyword refers to the execution context of the function. The execution context of a function is influenced by how a function is invoked.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>S.No</th>

    <article> How can the return type of a function be specified?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            The return type of a function is determined by what we choose to return from a function. We can return a primitive type, an object literal or a function.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What happens if there is no return statement in a function?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            if a function has no return type, it returns <strong>undefined</strong> by default.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What do the apply() and call() methods do? What is the difference? 
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            The <strong>apply()</strong>and <strong>call()</strong> methods are used to set the execution context of the function by passing in the object reference as the first parameter.

    <h3> Chapter 04 - Wielding Functions</h3>

    <article> What are anonymous functions?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Anonymous functions in JavaScript are functions without a name.
            example:
            <div class="code">
example:
var bar = function(){};
console.log(bar.name); // displays empty string ""

            </div>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Under what circumstances would they be needed?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Although anonymous functions have no performance benefits over the the named-functions, they make it convenient while defining functions expressions and callbacks. 
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How do we call the anonymous functions?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
             Anonymous functions are convenient as callbacks. Also, an anonymous function can be used in function expression.
             <div class="code">
example:
var bar = function(){};
Only the code that follows this function expression can call bar(). Any code before this expression will not be able to call it.

    <article> What is recursion?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Recursion is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly. A recursive function should ideally approach to a condition that will cause it to start returning in order to avoid running into stack overflow situation.

    <article> Is it possible to overload functions in JavaScript? If so, how?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Although JavaScript natively doesn't support function overloading, we can simulate it by inspecting the number of arguments passed in and using the switch statement for each case.
            <div class="code">
var bar = function(){
switch(arguments.length){
case 1 :// code for function with one argument
        break;
case 2 :// code for function with two arguments
        break;
case 3 :// code for function with three arguments
        break;
case default :// code for function with one argument;
        break;
