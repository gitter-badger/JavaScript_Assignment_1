    <h3> Chapter 01 - Basics of JavaScript</h3>

    <article> What are some cross-browser issues that affect JavaScript code?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Web browsers rely on two distinct engines to load and render a webpage.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript Engine </li>
                <li>
                    Rendering Engine
                </li>
            </ul> The inconsistent implementation of web standards by various browser vendors of these engines make it nearly impossible to be absolutely sure if the code we author will behave and appear the same way on every platform. The DOM API provided by each of these vendors differs ever so slightly making it difficult to write simple JavaScript code without having to include shims and polyfills or some sort of fallback mechanism</details>
    </article>
    <article> What tools are available to deal with these issues?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            It serves us well in general to follow these guidelines to get around these cross-browser issues
            <ul>
                <li>Don't leave anything to the browser to make assumptions. Instead be explicit wherever possible. Ex: include the DOCTYPE for every webpage</li>
                <li> Ensure the HTML document is valid and is wellformed</li>
                <li>Rely on popular JavaScript libraries and CSS frameworks that normalize the cross-browser idiosyncrasies.</li>
                <li>Use popular unit-testing tools such as Jasmine, mocha-chai to run tests in all the browsers using a testrunner such as Karma</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What considerations should we take when determining what browsers to support?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Although various strategies exist, the one that Yahoo follows seems to be more popular. It involves putting together a matrix which Yahoo calls the "graded browser matrix" where the browsers are along one axis and the platforms are along the second axis. We then need to grade them depending on the project requirements
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What sort of testing should we do on JavaScript code before deployment?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            Before deploying the JavaScript code, we should be certain that the test cases we author all pass and posses the three main characteristics, namely
            <ol>
                <li>Repeatability</li>
                <li>Simplicity</li>
                <li>Isolation/Independent</li>
            </ol>
            Types of testing would include
            <ul>
                <li>functionality</li>
                <li>performance</li>
                <li>compatibility</li>
            </ul> , There are two approaches to testing the code we write when we bump into a bug and we want to debug it.
            <ol>
                <li>Constructive</li>
                <li>Deconstructive</li>
            </ol>
        </details>
    </article>


    <h3>02 - Testing Frameworks</h3>

    <article> What debug tools can we use for JavaScript?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            We can use google chrome developer tools to place break points and perform stepwise execution to debug JavaScript. Also we could use the console.log() method to log to the console.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Explain how deconstructive and constructive test cases work.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <strong>Deconstructive</strong> test cases are composed by isolating just the code that constitute the system-under-test and eleminating the rest of the code that do not participate in the test cases. <strong>Constructive</strong> test cases on the other hand are put together by starting from a known good reduced case and go on adding code to it until a bug shows up.
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> What is the purpose of a testing framework?
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            A good testing framework enables us to organize our tests by grouping them together, allow us to see a dashboard of tests that have passed and the ones that need fixing. When it comes to JavaScript Unit-Testing frameworks aimed at the DOM API, we need a test-framework that can
            <ol>
                <li>simulate browser behavior such as mouse-hover, clicks, drag and drop</li>
                <li>allow us to control the test runner interactively</li>
                <li>give us the ability to filter what tests are to be executed</li>
                <li>provide a way to test asynchronous operations by grouping all those that depend on the same asynchronous operation</li>
            </ol>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> Name a few testing frameworks for JavaScript.
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            following are some of the popular JavaScript Testing Frameworks
            <ul>
                <li>Jasmine</li>
                <li>mocha with chai</li>
                <li>QUnit</li>
                <li>JsUnit</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

    <h3> Chapter 03 -  Functions</h3>

    <article> Explain how functions work in JavaScript
        <details class="question">
            <summary>Answer:</summary>
            <li>JavaScript functions can be invoked in one of four ways.
                <ol>
                    <li>as a function</li>
                    <li>as a method on an object</li>
                    <li>as an object constructor</li>
                    <li>as apply/call </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Every function is implicitly provided with two additional parameters, namely "this" and "arguments". The "this" parameter is influenced by above the invokation patterns (listed above) used </li>
            <li>Additionally, JavaScript functions are basically objects (mutable key-value pairs) and are instances of the core JavaScript object named "Function" Therefore every function has a hidden link to "Function.prototype". Which means that anything attached to the Function.prototype instantly becomes available to all instances the functions.
            </li>
            <li>Every function has a property called "prototype" which is an object consisting of a property called "constructor" whose value is the function itself.</li>
            <li>functions can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, they can be passed to other functions as arguments and returned from other functions as values.</li>
        </details>
    </article>
    <article> How are they declared?
        <details class="question"><summary>Answer:</summary>
        We could use one of two syntaxes to declare JavaScript functions.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>function declaration/statement syntax</strong> where the function declaration is hoisted to the top of the function scope.
                <details><summary>code</summary>
                <div class="code">example:
                
    function bar(){
        //code here
    }
               </div></details>
            </li>
            <li><strong>function expression sytax(the preferred way)</strong> where the function declaration is <strong>not</strong> hoisted and can only be called <strong>after</strong> the function has been defined.
                <details><summary>code</summary>        <div class="code">example:
                
    var bar = function bar(){
        //code here
    }
              OR
    
    var bar = function (){
        //code here
    }
               </div></details>
            </li>
        </ul></details>
